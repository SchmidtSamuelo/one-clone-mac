# one-clone-mac
This repository serves as a one-click clone for all of my personalized configuration on mac. 
It attempts to mimic the windows keyboard layout shortcuts for external keyboards connected to the macbook pro, specifically on modifier keys (ctrl, cmd, opt are all swapped around and mapped to function similarly to windows).

If using an external keyboard (which this is designed for) you should use the following keyboard preferences configuration for modifier keys:

Caps Lock => Caps Lock

Control => Control

Option => Command

Command => Option

Function => Function
